# Hawk

Transform text from the command-line using Haskell expressions. Similar to [awk](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/index.html), but using Haskell as the text-processing language.

## Examples

In [Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) the file `/etc/passwd` is used to
keep track of every registered user in the system. Each entry in the file
contains information about a single user, using a simple colon-separated format.
For example:

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

The first field is the username. We can use Hawk to list all usernames as follows:

```bash
> cat /etc/passwd | hawk -d: -m 'head'
root
```

The `-d` option tells Hawk to use `:` as word delimiters, causing the first line to be interpreted as `["root", "x", "0", "0", "root", "/root", "/bin/bash"]`.
The `-m` tells Hawk to map a function over each line of the input. In this case, this means to extract the first word of each line, which happens to be the username.

We could of course have achieved identical results by using awk instead of Hawk:

```bash
> cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1}'
```

While Hawk and awk have similar use cases, the philosophy behind the two is very
different. Instead of creating an ad-hoc language like awk does, Hawk uses
Haskell and can easily use all the libraries available for it.
There are many standard command-line tools that can be easily approximated using
[short Haskell expressions](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Simple_Unix_tools).
The Hawk runtime environment is made to be fully customizable: there is
a [prelude file](https://github.com/gelisam/hawk/tree/master/doc#user-prelude)
which contains imported modules, language extensions and
user defined functions. This file can be populated with functions to use inside
Hawk. For instance, we could add a `takeNFrom` function that gets elements in an
interval of the input:

```bash
> echo 'takeNFrom i c = take c . drop i' >> ~/.hawk/prelude.hs
> seq 0 100 | hawk -a 'takeNFrom 10 3'
10
11
12
```


For more details, see the [documentation](doc/README.md).

## Installation

To install the development version, clone this repository and use `cabal
install` or `cabal-dev install` to compile Hawk and its dependencies. Cabal
installs the binary to `~/.cabal/bin/hawk`, while cabal-dev installs it to
`./cabal-dev/bin/hawk`. The first run will create a default configuration into
`~/.hawk/prelude.hs` if it doesn't exist.
