# Hawk Documentation

```bash
> seq 3 | hawk -a 'L.reverse'
3
2
1
```

Hawk is a command-line tool for manipulating text. Like [awk](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/index.html), it supports an unbounded number of text transformations, implemented by the user via an expression language. In the case of Hawk, the expression language is [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/), whose basics are assumed to be familar to the reader.


## Overview: beyond one-liners

Command-line tools such as [awk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) are best for one-liners, while compiled languages such as [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) are intended for larger projects, spanning several modules and thousands of lines of code. Hawk fills the gap between those two extremes.

```bash
> seq 10 | hawk -ad 'L.takeWhile (/="7") . L.dropWhile (/="3")'
3
4
5
6
```

Hawk lets you write Haskell one-liners on the command-line. When your one-liner grows too large to fit on a single line, move some of it to `~/.hawk/prelude.hs`, a Haskell module which hosts your custom helper functions.

```bash
> echo 'between x y = L.takeWhile (/=y) . L.dropWhile (/=x)' >> ~/.hawk/prelude.hs
> seq 10 | hawk -ad 'between "3" "7"'
3
4
5
6
```

The above example illustrates how to create a new helper function `between`, and how to use it from Hawk. Whenever we use such helper functions, we will link to an example prelude containing the required definitions, like this:

([prelude.hs](between/prelude.hs))

If your prelude becomes too crowded, it might be a sign that your task is too big for Hawk. Simply move your prelude file to the folder of your choice, as the first module of a new Haskell project.


## When should I use Hawk?

At the moment, Hawk is best at filtering and reorganizing collections of strings organized in a table or as a sequence of lines. Many standard command-line tools can be easily approximated using [very short Haskell expressions](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Simple_Unix_tools); for example, here is a simplified version of [`head`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_%28Unix%29).

```bash
> seq 10 | hawk -a 'L.take 3'
1
2
3
```

The original `head`, of course, is shorter and has more options. Hawk is useful when there isn't already a standard unix tool for what you need. For example, there is a standard tool for flipping tables vertically, but there is no tool for flipping them horizontally:

```bash
> printf "1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n" | tac
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3
> printf "1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n" | hawk -m 'L.reverse'
3 2 1
6 5 4
9 8 7
```

Similarly-short expressions could be used to transpose, rotate, flatten, and so on. With a bit more effort, much more involved transformations are also possible. For example, here we use a helper function to parse the input's indentation structure into a tree, and we use a few concatenations to shape this tree into a lisp-style expression.

```bash
> cat example.in
foo
  bar1
  bar2
    baz
  bar3
> $ hawk -ad 'postorder (\x xs -> "("<>x<>(B.concat(L.map(" "<>)xs))<>")")' example.in
(foo (bar1) (bar2 (baz)) (bar3))
```
([prelude.hs](postorder/prelude.hs))

Numerical operations are possible, but a bit inconvenient because we expose the input as a collection of ByteString values, which need to be [unpacked](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/bytestring/latest/doc/html/Data-ByteString-Lazy-Char8.html#v:unpack) and [read](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#v:read) before being manipulated.

```bash
> seq 3 | hawk -ad 'sum . L.map (read . B.unpack)'
6
```
