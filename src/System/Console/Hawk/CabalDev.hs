-- Extra steps to be performed if hawk was installed from cabal-dev.
-- 
-- Extra steps are needed because the hawk binary needs runtime access
-- to the hawk library, but the hint library only knows about the globally-
-- installed libraries. If hawk has been installed with cabal-dev, its
-- binary and its library will be installed in a local folder instead of
-- in the global location.
